Thoughts:

1. Ball is a DTO without behavior.  Separation between display and physics model
    What do you think?
2. Panel - IntelJ wants to refactor it.
3. The ugly drop ball method

Show the entire cushion with diamond markings. Then in checkForPockets,
will need to move the balls off the table.   The pockets will be bigger

Double check for turning inactive if beyond the cushion area.
