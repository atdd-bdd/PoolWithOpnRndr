Thoughts:

1. Ball is a DTO without behavior.  Separtion between display and physics model
    What do you think?
2. Panel - IntellJ wants to refactor it.
3. The ugly dropball method

Rearrange the UI so that less needed things are on the left.
Top row should have Cue Stroke,

Add a slider to set the move increment (1 to 100)

Add a "Rack" button

    Add the load and store functionality
    Will the file include both balls and the table constants?

Add communication with sockets -
    Send the cue stroke over - set table constants from that

Show the entire cushion with diamond markings. Then in checkForPockets,
will need to move the balls off the table.   The pockets will be bigger

Double check for turning inactive if beyond the cushion area.
