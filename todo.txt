Add a check for energy and momentum - report if increased over initial energy when cue is struck

Check for position+velocity/loop post collision to see if still in collision.  If so, then move balls out of collision range by
incrementing both by that amount -  may do this in loop upto 10 times to make sure they aren't sill in collision
Print out if collision returns


Switch to GUI for OpenRndr -  that doesn't work !!!

Add sliders for elasticity, restitution - not enough room

Make variables out of all constants ,   force, etc.

Change force to a color change

Use table size to compute the other display values



Add a "tweaker" for the angle

Add button to do a "replay"

Add button to do a pause (should have a  hit and a pause button)

Add "games" with different number of balls and different values

Add dropdown list to select a game - standard, other

Add the pockets - show the circles.  A line segment over each.
    CheckForPocket - if position of ball croses the line segment, then
        set inactive.
    For each ball loop, continue if inactive

When "stopped", set all velocities to zero

s
